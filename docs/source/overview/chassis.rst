Chassis
=======

The vehicle features a modular design that is based around a central chassis, shown in Fig 9. The chassis is made from water-jet aluminum sheets and joined with stainless steel fasteners. There are hard-points for securing the toolpackages and reinforced regions to handle the vehicle. The vehicle may be carried by handles on the front and rear or hung from a crane to allow easy deployment.
