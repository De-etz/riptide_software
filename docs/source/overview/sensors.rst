Sensors
=======

The sensor suite that is utilized on Riptide consists of two inertial measurement units (IMU), one LORD MicroStrain 3DM-GX4-25 and one 9-DOF RAZOR IMU, for acceleration and orientation information, three PointGrey Blackfly USB3 Vision cameras (BFLY-U3-13S2C-CS) for vision processing and visual odometry, one Blue Robotics Bar30 pressure sensor for measuring the depth of the vehicle, and three Aquarian Audio H1C hydrophones for acoustic signal processing.
